<p>I have been accepted for GSoC’23 as a contributor! I will be contributing
to Git and the project I will be working on is
<br />
<strong> Unify ref-filter formats with other –pretty formats </strong>
<br /></p>

<p>My proposal can be read at [GSoC_Proposal][gsoc-prop]
<br /></p>

<p>The Git Community has been very supportive and I have learnt so much
in the time I spent with them before GSoC. Hoping that I will
continue to learn while working on this project and bond more
with the community.
<br /></p>

<p>My mentors are
<br />
	Christian Couder <a href="mailto:christian.couder@gmail.com">christian.couder@gmail.com</a>
	Hariom Verma <a href="mailto:hariom18599@gmail.com">hariom18599@gmail.com</a>
<br /></p>

<p>The main code repo, where I’ll be working at is [repo][repo]
<br /></p>

<h4 id="what-now">What Now?</h4>
<p>I am currently working on the duplication of the logic, in pretty, in
ref-filter. Especially on the patches that Nsengiyumva Wilberforce sent
regarding the duplication of logic that formats commit and tag signatures.
Nsengiyumva’s patches can be read on the [mailing list][nw-patches].
<br /></p>

<p>These patches seem to breaking CI, so I am working on them (see [branch][sign1])
as they are really helpful in accomplishing the goal of this project.
<br /></p>

<p>The code for the files ref-filter.{c, h} and pretty.{c, h} can be read
at the [git repo][git]
<br /></p>

<p>I will be updating this blog weekly on Wednesdays, tracking my progress
in that week.</p>

<p>‘til next time,
Kousik</p>
